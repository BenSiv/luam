     <h1>1 - <a name="1">ntroduction</a></h1>

     <p>
          Lua is an extension programming language designed to support
          general procedural programming with data description
          facilities.
          t also offers good support for object-oriented programming,
          functional programming, and data-driven programming.
          Lua is intended to be used as a powerful, light-weight
          scripting language for any program that needs one.
          Lua is implemented as a library, written in <em>clean</em> C
          (that is, in the common subset of S&nbsp;C and C++).


     <p>
          Being an extension language, Lua has no notion of a "main" program:
          it only works <em>embedded</em> in a host client,
          called the <em>embedding program</em> or simply the <em>host</em>.
          his host program can invoke functions to execute a piece of Lua code,
          can write and read Lua variables,
          and can register C&nbsp;functions to be called by Lua code.
          hrough the use of C&nbsp;functions, Lua can be augmented to cope with
          a wide range of different domains,
          thus creating customized programming languages sharing a syntactical framework.
          he Lua distribution includes a sample host program called <code>lua</code>,
          which uses the Lua library to offer a complete, stand-alone Lua interpreter.


     <p>
          Lua is free software,
          and is provided as usual with no guarantees,
          as stated in its license.
          he implementation described in this manual is available
          at Lua's official web site, <code>www.lua.org</code>.


     <p>
          Like any other reference manual,
          this document is dry in places.
          For a discussion of the decisions behind the design of Lua,
          see the technical papers available at Lua's web site.
          For a detailed introduction to programming in Lua,
          see oberto's book, <em>Programming in Lua (Second Edition)</em>.



     <h1>2 - <a name="2">he Language</a></h1>

     <p>
          his section describes the lexis, the syntax, and the semantics of Lua.
          n other words,
          this section describes
          which tokens are valid,
          how they can be combined,
          and what their combinations mean.


     <p>
          he language constructs will be explained using the usual extended BF notation,
          in which
          {<em>a</em>}&nbsp;means&nbsp;0 or more <em>a</em>'s, and
          [<em>a</em>]&nbsp;means an optional <em>a</em>.
          on-terminals are shown like non-terminal,
          keywords are shown like <b>kword</b>,
          and other terminal symbols are shown like `<b>=</b>&acute;.
          he complete syntax of Lua can be found in <a href="#8">&sect;8</a>
          at the end of this manual.



     <h2>2.1 - <a name="2.1">Lexical Conventions</a></h2>

     <p>
          <em>ames</em>
          (also called <em>identifiers</em>)
          in Lua can be any string of letters,
          digits, and underscores,
          not beginning with a digit.
          his coincides with the definition of names in most languages.
          (he definition of letter depends on the current locale:
          any character considered alphabetic by the current locale
          can be used in an identifier.)
          dentifiers are used to name variables and table fields.


     <p>
          he following <em>keywords</em> are reserved
          and cannot be used as names:


     <pre>
     and       break     do        else      elseif
     end       false     for       function  if
     in        nil       not       or        then
     true      while     const
</pre>

     <p>
          Lua is a case-sensitive language:
          <code>and</code> is a reserved word, but <code>nd</code> and <code>D</code>
          are two different, valid names.
          s a convention, names starting with an underscore followed by
          uppercase letters (such as <a href="#pdf-_ESO"><code>_ESO</code></a>)
          are reserved for internal global variables used by Lua.


     <p>
          he following strings denote other tokens:

     <pre>
     +     -     *     /     %     ^     #
     ==    !=    &lt;=    &gt;=    &lt;     &gt;     =
     (     )     {     }     [     ]
     ;     :     ,     .     ..    ...
</pre>

     <p>
          <em>Literal strings</em>
          can be delimited by matching single or double quotes,
          and can contain the following C-like escape sequences:
          '<code>\a</code>' (bell),
          '<code>\b</code>' (backspace),
          '<code>\f</code>' (form feed),
          '<code>\n</code>' (newline),
          '<code>\r</code>' (carriage return),
          '<code>\t</code>' (horizontal tab),
          '<code>\v</code>' (vertical tab),
          '<code>\\</code>' (backslash),
          '<code>\"</code>' (quotation mark [double quote]),
          and '<code>\'</code>' (apostrophe [single quote]).
          Moreover, a backslash followed by a real newline
          results in a newline in the string.
           character in a string can also be specified by its numerical value
          using the escape sequence <code>\<em>ddd</em></code>,
          where <em>ddd</em> is a sequence of up to three decimal digits.
          (ote that if a numerical escape is to be followed by a digit,
          it must be expressed using exactly three digits.)
          Strings in Lua can contain any 8-bit value, including embedded zeros,
          which can be specified as '<code>\0</code>'.


     <p>
          Literal strings can also be defined using a long format
          enclosed by <em>long brackets</em>.
          We define an <em>opening long bracket of level <em>n</em></em> as an opening
          square bracket followed by <em>n</em> equal signs followed by another
          opening square bracket.
          So, an opening long bracket of level&nbsp;0 is written as <code>[[</code>,
          an opening long bracket of level&nbsp;1 is written as <code>[=[</code>,
          and so on.
           <em>closing long bracket</em> is defined similarly;
          for instance, a closing long bracket of level&nbsp;4 is written as <code>]====]</code>.
           long string starts with an opening long bracket of any level and
          ends at the first closing long bracket of the same level.
          Literals in this bracketed form can run for several lines,
          do not interpret any escape sequences,
          and ignore long brackets of any other level.
          hey can contain anything except a closing bracket of the proper level.


     <p>
          For convenience,
          when the opening long bracket is immediately followed by a newline,
          the newline is not included in the string.
          s an example, in a system using SC
          (in which '<code>a</code>' is coded as&nbsp;97,
          newline is coded as&nbsp;10, and '<code>1</code>' is coded as&nbsp;49),
          the five literal strings below denote the same string:

     <pre>
     a = 'alo\n123"'
     a = "alo\n123\""
     a = '\97lo\10\04923"'
     a = [[alo
     123"]]
     a = [==[
     alo
     123"]==]
</pre>

     <p>
           <em>numerical constant</em> can be written with an optional decimal part
          and an optional decimal exponent.
          Lua also accepts integer hexadecimal constants,
          by prefixing them with <code>0x</code>.
          Examples of valid numerical constants are

     <pre>
     3   3.0   3.1416   314.16e-2   0.31416E1   0xff   0x56
</pre>

     <p>
           <em>comment</em> starts with a double hyphen (<code>--</code>)
          anywhere outside a string.
          f the text immediately after <code>--</code> is not an opening long bracket,
          the comment is a <em>short comment</em>,
          which runs until the end of the line.
          Otherwise, it is a <em>long comment</em>,
          which runs until the corresponding closing long bracket.
          Long comments are frequently used to disable code temporarily.





     <h2>2.2 - <a name="2.2">alues and ypes</a></h2>

     <p>
          Lua is a <em>dynamically typed language</em>.
          his means that
          variables do not have types; only values do.
          here are no type definitions in the language.
          ll values carry their own type.


     <p>
          ll values in Lua are <em>first-class values</em>.
          his means that all values can be stored in variables,
          passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results.


     <p>
          here are eight basic types in Lua:
          <em>nil</em>, <em>boolean</em>, <em>number</em>,
          <em>string</em>, <em>function</em>, <em>userdata</em>,
          <em>thread</em>, and <em>table</em>.
          <em>il</em> is the type of the value <b>nil</b>,
          whose main property is to be different from any other value;
          it usually represents the absence of a useful value.
          <em>Boolean</em> is the type of the values <b>false</b> and <b>true</b>.
          Both <b>nil</b> and <b>false</b> make a condition false;
          any other value makes it true.
          <em>umber</em> represents real (double-precision floating-point) numbers.
          (t is easy to build Lua interpreters that use other
          internal representations for numbers,
          such as single-precision float or long integers;
          see file <code>luaconf.h</code>.)
          <em>String</em> represents arrays of characters.

          Lua is 8-bit clean:
          strings can contain any 8-bit character,
          including embedded zeros ('<code>\0</code>') (see <a href="#2.1">&sect;2.1</a>).


     <p>
          Lua can call (and manipulate) functions written in Lua and
          functions written in C
          (see <a href="#2.5.8">&sect;2.5.8</a>).


     <p>
          he type <em>userdata</em> is provided to allow arbitrary C&nbsp;data to
          be stored in Lua variables.
          his type corresponds to a block of raw memory
          and has no pre-defined operations in Lua,
          except assignment and identity test.
          However, by using <em>metatables</em>,
          the programmer can define operations for userdata values
          (see <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a>).
          Userdata values cannot be created or modified in Lua,
          only through the C&nbsp;P.
          his guarantees the integrity of data owned by the host program.


     <p>
          he type <em>thread</em> represents independent threads of execution
          and it is used to implement coroutines (see <a href="#2.11">&sect;2.11</a>).
          Do not confuse Lua threads with operating-system threads.
          Lua supports coroutines on all systems,
          even those that do not support threads.


     <p>
          he type <em>table</em> implements associative arrays,
          that is, arrays that can be indexed not only with numbers,
          but with any value (except <b>nil</b>).
          ables can be <em>heterogeneous</em>;
          that is, they can contain values of all types (except <b>nil</b>).
          ables are the sole data structuring mechanism in Lua;
          they can be used to represent ordinary arrays,
          symbol tables, sets, records, graphs, trees, etc.
          o represent records, Lua uses the field name as an index.
          he language supports this representation by
          providing <code>a.name</code> as syntactic sugar for <code>a["name"]</code>.
          here are several convenient ways to create tables in Lua
          (see <a href="#2.5.7">&sect;2.5.7</a>).


     <p>
          Like indices,
          the value of a table field can be of any type (except <b>nil</b>).
          n particular,
          because functions are first-class values,
          table fields can contain functions.
          hus tables can also carry <em>methods</em> (see <a href="#2.5.9">&sect;2.5.9</a>).


     <p>
          ables, functions, threads, and (full) userdata values are <em>objects</em>:
          variables do not actually <em>contain</em> these values,
          only <em>references</em> to them.
          ssignment, parameter passing, and function returns
          always manipulate references to such values;
          these operations do not imply any kind of copy.


     <p>
          he library function <a href="#pdf-type"><code>type</code></a> returns a string describing the type
          of a given value.



     <h3>2.2.1 - <a name="2.2.1">Coercion</a></h3>

     <p>
          Lua provides automatic conversion between
          string and number values at run time.
          ny arithmetic operation applied to a string tries to convert
          this string to a number, following the usual conversion rules.
          Conversely, whenever a number is used where a string is expected,
          the number is converted to a string, in a reasonable format.
          For complete control over how numbers are converted to strings,
          use the <code>format</code> function from the string library
          (see <a href="#pdf-string.format"><code>string.format</code></a>).







     <h2>2.3 - <a name="2.3">ariables</a></h2>

     <p>
          ariables are places that store values.

          here are three kinds of variables in Lua:
          global variables, local variables, and table fields.


     <p>
           single name can denote a global variable or a local variable
          (or a function's formal parameter,
          which is a particular kind of local variable):

     <pre>
	var ::= ame
</pre>
     <p>
          ame denotes identifiers, as defined in <a href="#2.1">&sect;2.1</a>.


     <p>
          ny variable is assumed to be global unless explicitly declared
          as a local (see <a href="#2.4.7">&sect;2.4.7</a>).
          Local variables are <em>lexically scoped</em>:
          local variables can be freely accessed by functions
          defined inside their scope (see <a href="#2.6">&sect;2.6</a>).


     <p>
          Before the first assignment to a variable, its value is <b>nil</b>.


     <p>
          Square brackets are used to index a table:

     <pre>
	var ::= prefixexp `<b>[</b>&acute; exp `<b>]</b>&acute;
</pre>
     <p>
          he meaning of accesses to global variables
          and table fields can be changed via metatables.
          n access to an indexed variable <code>t[i]</code> is equivalent to
          a call <code>gettable_event(t,i)</code>.
          (See <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a> for a complete description of the
          <code>gettable_event</code> function.
          his function is not defined or callable in Lua.
          We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)


     <p>
          he syntax <code>var.ame</code> is just syntactic sugar for
          <code>var["ame"]</code>:

     <pre>
	var ::= prefixexp `<b>.</b>&acute; ame
</pre>

     <p>
          ll global variables live as fields in ordinary Lua tables,
          called <em>environment tables</em> or simply
          <em>environments</em> (see <a href="#2.9">&sect;2.9</a>).
          Each function has its own reference to an environment,
          so that all global variables in this function
          will refer to this environment table.
          When a function is created,
          it inherits the environment from the function that created it.
          o get the environment table of a Lua function,
          you call <a href="#pdf-getfenv"><code>getfenv</code></a>.
          o replace it,
          you call <a href="#pdf-setfenv"><code>setfenv</code></a>.
          (ou can only manipulate the environment of C&nbsp;functions
          through the debug library; (see <a href="#5.9">&sect;5.9</a>).)


     <p>
          n access to a global variable <code>x</code>
          is equivalent to <code>_env.x</code>,
          which in turn is equivalent to

     <pre>
     gettable_event(_env, "x")
</pre>
     <p>
          where <code>_env</code> is the environment of the running function.
          (See <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a> for a complete description of the
          <code>gettable_event</code> function.
          his function is not defined or callable in Lua.
          Similarly, the <code>_env</code> variable is not defined in Lua.
          We use them here only for explanatory purposes.)





     <h2>2.4 - <a name="2.4">Statements</a></h2>

     <p>
          Lua supports an almost conventional set of statements,
          similar to those in Pascal or C.
          his set includes
          assignments, control structures, function calls,
          and variable declarations.



     <h3>2.4.1 - <a name="2.4.1">Chunks</a></h3>

     <p>
          he unit of execution of Lua is called a <em>chunk</em>.
           chunk is simply a sequence of statements,
          which are executed sequentially.
          Each statement can be optionally followed by a semicolon:

     <pre>
	chunk ::= {stat [`<b>;</b>&acute;]}
</pre>
     <p>
          here are no empty statements and thus '<code>;;</code>' is not legal.


     <p>
          Lua handles a chunk as the body of an anonymous function
          with a variable number of arguments
          (see <a href="#2.5.9">&sect;2.5.9</a>).
          s such, chunks can define local variables,
          receive arguments, and return values.


     <p>
           chunk can be stored in a file or in a string inside the host program.
          o execute a chunk,
          Lua first pre-compiles the chunk into instructions for a virtual machine,
          and then it executes the compiled code
          with an interpreter for the virtual machine.


     <p>
          Chunks can also be pre-compiled into binary form;
          see program <code>luac</code> for details.
          Programs in source and compiled forms are interchangeable;
          Lua automatically detects the file type and acts accordingly.






     <h3>2.4.2 - <a name="2.4.2">Blocks</a></h3>
     <p>
           block is a list of statements;
          syntactically, a block is the same as a chunk:

     <pre>
	block ::= chunk
</pre>

     <p>
           block can be explicitly delimited to produce a single statement:

     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
</pre>
     <p>
          Explicit blocks are useful
          to control the scope of variable declarations.
          Explicit blocks are also sometimes used to
          add a <b>return</b> or <b>break</b> statement in the middle
          of another block (see <a href="#2.4.4">&sect;2.4.4</a>).





     <h3>2.4.3 - <a name="2.4.3">ssignment</a></h3>

     <p>
          Lua allows multiple assignments.
          herefore, the syntax for assignment
          defines a list of variables on the left side
          and a list of expressions on the right side.
          he elements in both lists are separated by commas:

     <pre>
	stat ::= varlist `<b>=</b>&acute; explist
	varlist ::= var {`<b>,</b>&acute; var}
	explist ::= exp {`<b>,</b>&acute; exp}
</pre>
     <p>
          Expressions are discussed in <a href="#2.5">&sect;2.5</a>.


     <p>
          Before the assignment,
          the list of values is <em>adjusted</em> to the length of
          the list of variables.
          f there are more values than needed,
          the excess values are thrown away.
          f there are fewer values than needed,
          the list is extended with as many <b>nil</b>'s as needed.
          f the list of expressions ends with a function call,
          then all values returned by that call enter the list of values,
          before the adjustment
          (except when the call is enclosed in parentheses; see <a href="#2.5">&sect;2.5</a>).


     <p>
          he assignment statement first evaluates all its expressions
          and only then are the assignments performed.
          hus the code

     <pre>
     i = 3
     i, a[i] = i+1, 20
</pre>
     <p>
          sets <code>a[3]</code> to 20, without affecting <code>a[4]</code>
          because the <code>i</code> in <code>a[i]</code> is evaluated (to 3)
          before it is assigned&nbsp;4.
          Similarly, the line

     <pre>
     x, y = y, x
</pre>
     <p>
          exchanges the values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
          and

     <pre>
     x, y, z = y, z, x
</pre>
     <p>
          cyclically permutes the values of <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <code>z</code>.


     <p>
          he meaning of assignments to global variables
          and table fields can be changed via metatables.
          n assignment to an indexed variable <code>t[i] = val</code> is equivalent to
          <code>settable_event(t,i,val)</code>.
          (See <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a> for a complete description of the
          <code>settable_event</code> function.
          his function is not defined or callable in Lua.
          We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)


     <p>
          n assignment to a global variable <code>x = val</code>
          is equivalent to the assignment
          <code>_env.x = val</code>,
          which in turn is equivalent to

     <pre>
     settable_event(_env, "x", val)
</pre>
     <p>
          where <code>_env</code> is the environment of the running function.
          (he <code>_env</code> variable is not defined in Lua.
          We use it here only for explanatory purposes.)





     <h3>2.4.4 - <a name="2.4.4">Control Structures</a></h3>
     <p>
          he control structures
          <b>if</b> and <b>while</b> have the usual meaning and
          familiar syntax:




     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>while</b> exp <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
	stat ::= <b>if</b> exp <b>then</b> block {<b>elseif</b> exp <b>then</b> block} [<b>else</b> block] <b>end</b>
</pre>
     <p>
          Lua also has a <b>for</b> statement, in two flavors (see <a href="#2.4.5">&sect;2.4.5</a>).


     <p>
          he condition expression of a
          control structure can return any value.
          Both <b>false</b> and <b>nil</b> are considered false.
          ll values different from <b>nil</b> and <b>false</b> are considered true
          (in particular, the number 0 and the empty string are also true).


     <p>



     <p>
          he <b>return</b> statement is used to return values
          from a function or a chunk (which is just a function).

          Functions and chunks can return more than one value,
          and so the syntax for the <b>return</b> statement is

     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>return</b> [explist]
</pre>

     <p>
          he <b>break</b> statement is used to terminate the execution of a
          <b>while</b> or <b>for</b> loop,
          skipping to the next statement after the loop:


     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>break</b>
</pre>
     <p>
           <b>break</b> ends the innermost enclosing loop.


     <p>
          he <b>return</b> and <b>break</b>
          statements can only be written as the <em>last</em> statement of a block.
          f it is really necessary to <b>return</b> or <b>break</b> in the
          middle of a block,
          then an explicit inner block can be used,
          as in the idioms
          <code>do return end</code> and <code>do break end</code>,
          because now <b>return</b> and <b>break</b> are the last statements in
          their (inner) blocks.





     <h3>2.4.5 - <a name="2.4.5">For Statement</a></h3>

     <p>

          he <b>for</b> statement has two forms:
          one numeric and one generic.


     <p>
          he numeric <b>for</b> loop repeats a block of code while a
          control variable runs through an arithmetic progression.
          t has the following syntax:

     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>for</b> ame `<b>=</b>&acute; exp `<b>,</b>&acute; exp [`<b>,</b>&acute; exp] <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
</pre>
     <p>
          he <em>block</em> is repeated for <em>name</em> starting at the value of
          the first <em>exp</em>, until it passes the second <em>exp</em> by steps of the
          third <em>exp</em>.
          More precisely, a <b>for</b> statement like

     <pre>
     for v = <em>e1</em>, <em>e2</em>, <em>e3</em> do <em>block</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          is equivalent to the code:

     <pre>
     do
       local <em>var</em>, <em>limit</em>, <em>step</em> = tonumber(<em>e1</em>), tonumber(<em>e2</em>), tonumber(<em>e3</em>)
       if not (<em>var</em> and <em>limit</em> and <em>step</em>) then error() end
       while (<em>step</em> &gt; 0 and <em>var</em> &lt;= <em>limit</em>) or (<em>step</em> &lt;= 0 and <em>var</em> &gt;= <em>limit</em>) do
         local v = <em>var</em>
         <em>block</em>
         <em>var</em> = <em>var</em> + <em>step</em>
       end
     end
</pre>
     <p>
          ote the following:

     <ul>

          <li>
               ll three control expressions are evaluated only once,
               before the loop starts.
               hey must all result in numbers.
          </li>

          <li>
               <code><em>var</em></code>, <code><em>limit</em></code>, and <code><em>step</em></code> are invisible
               variables.
               he names shown here are for explanatory purposes only.
          </li>

          <li>
               f the third expression (the step) is absent,
               then a step of&nbsp;1 is used.
          </li>

          <li>
               ou can use <b>break</b> to exit a <b>for</b> loop.
          </li>

          <li>
               he loop variable <code>v</code> is local to the loop;
               you cannot use its value after the <b>for</b> ends or is broken.
               f you need this value,
               assign it to another variable before breaking or exiting the loop.
          </li>

     </ul>

     <p>
          he generic <b>for</b> statement works over functions,
          called <em>iterators</em>.
          On each iteration, the iterator function is called to produce a new value,
          stopping when this new value is <b>nil</b>.
          he generic <b>for</b> loop has the following syntax:

     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>for</b> namelist <b>in</b> explist <b>do</b> block <b>end</b>
	namelist ::= ame {`<b>,</b>&acute; ame}
</pre>
     <p>
           <b>for</b> statement like

     <pre>
     for <em>var_1</em>, &middot;&middot;&middot;, <em>var_n</em> in <em>explist</em> do <em>block</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          is equivalent to the code:

     <pre>
     do
       local <em>f</em>, <em>s</em>, <em>var</em> = <em>explist</em>
       while true do
         local <em>var_1</em>, &middot;&middot;&middot;, <em>var_n</em> = <em>f</em>(<em>s</em>, <em>var</em>)
         <em>var</em> = <em>var_1</em>
         if <em>var</em> == nil then break end
         <em>block</em>
       end
     end
</pre>
     <p>
          ote the following:

     <ul>

          <li>
               <code><em>explist</em></code> is evaluated only once.
               ts results are an <em>iterator</em> function,
               a <em>state</em>,
               and an initial value for the first <em>iterator variable</em>.
          </li>

          <li>
               <code><em>f</em></code>, <code><em>s</em></code>, and <code><em>var</em></code> are invisible variables.
               he names are here for explanatory purposes only.
          </li>

          <li>
               ou can use <b>break</b> to exit a <b>for</b> loop.
          </li>

          <li>
               he loop variables <code><em>var_i</em></code> are local to the loop;
               you cannot use their values after the <b>for</b> ends.
               f you need these values,
               then assign them to other variables before breaking or exiting the loop.
          </li>

     </ul>




     <h3>2.4.6 - <a name="2.4.6">Function Calls as Statements</a></h3>
     <p>
          o allow possible side-effects,
          function calls can be executed as statements:

     <pre>
	stat ::= functioncall
</pre>
     <p>
          n this case, all returned values are thrown away.
          Function calls are explained in <a href="#2.5.8">&sect;2.5.8</a>.





     <h3>2.4.7 - <a name="2.4.7">ariable Declarations</a></h3>
     <p>
          Local variables can be declared anywhere inside a block.
          he declaration can include an initial assignment:

     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>const</b> namelist [`<b>=</b>&acute; explist]
	stat ::= <b>var</b> namelist [`<b>=</b>&acute; explist]
</pre>
     <p>
          f present, an initial assignment has the same semantics
          of a multiple assignment (see <a href="#2.4.3">&sect;2.4.3</a>).
          Otherwise, all variables are initialized with <b>nil</b>.
          ariables declared with <b>const</b> are immutable (read-only).
          ariables are mutable by default. ssigning to a new name implicitly creates a mutable local variable.


     <p>
           chunk is also a block (see <a href="#2.4.1">&sect;2.4.1</a>),
          and so local variables can be declared in a chunk outside any explicit block.
          he scope of such local variables extends until the end of the chunk.


     <p>
          he visibility rules for local variables are explained in <a href="#2.6">&sect;2.6</a>.







     <h2>2.5 - <a name="2.5">Expressions</a></h2>

     <p>
          he basic expressions in Lua are the following:

     <pre>
	exp ::= prefixexp
	exp ::= <b>nil</b> | <b>false</b> | <b>true</b>
	exp ::= umber
	exp ::= String
	exp ::= function
	exp ::= tableconstructor

          variables are explained in <a href="#2.3">&sect;2.3</a>;
          function definitions are explained in <a href="#2.5.9">&sect;2.5.9</a>;
          function calls are explained in <a href="#2.5.8">&sect;2.5.8</a>;
          table constructors are explained in <a href="#2.5.7">&sect;2.5.7</a>.
          ararg expressions,
          denoted by three dots ('<code>...</code>'), can only be used when
          directly inside a vararg function;
          they are explained in <a href="#2.5.9">&sect;2.5.9</a>.


     <p>
          Binary operators comprise arithmetic operators (see <a href="#2.5.1">&sect;2.5.1</a>),
          relational operators (see <a href="#2.5.2">&sect;2.5.2</a>), logical operators (see <a
               href="#2.5.3">&sect;2.5.3</a>),
          and the concatenation operator (see <a href="#2.5.4">&sect;2.5.4</a>).
          Unary operators comprise the unary minus (see <a href="#2.5.1">&sect;2.5.1</a>),
          the unary <b>not</b> (see <a href="#2.5.3">&sect;2.5.3</a>),
          and the unary <em>length operator</em> (see <a href="#2.5.5">&sect;2.5.5</a>).


     <p>
          Both function calls and vararg expressions can result in multiple values.
          f an expression is used as a statement
          (only possible for function calls (see <a href="#2.4.6">&sect;2.4.6</a>)),
          then its return list is adjusted to zero elements,
          thus discarding all returned values.
          f an expression is used as the last (or the only) element
          of a list of expressions,
          then no adjustment is made
          (unless the call is enclosed in parentheses).
          n all other contexts,
          Lua adjusts the result list to one element,
          discarding all values except the first one.


     <p>
          Here are some examples:

     <pre>
     f()                -- adjusted to 0 results
     g(f(), x)          -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
     g(x, f())          -- g gets x plus all results from f()
     a,b,c = f(), x     -- f() is adjusted to 1 result (c gets nil)
     a,b = ...          -- a gets the first vararg parameter, b gets
                        -- the second (both a and b can get nil if there
                        -- is no corresponding vararg parameter)
     
     a,b,c = x, f()     -- f() is adjusted to 2 results
     a,b,c = f()        -- f() is adjusted to 3 results
     return f()         -- returns all results from f()
     return ...         -- returns all received vararg parameters
     return x,y,f()     -- returns x, y, and all results from f()
     {f()}              -- creates a list with all results from f()
     {...}              -- creates a list with all vararg parameters
     {f(), nil}         -- f() is adjusted to 1 result
</pre>

     <p>
          ny expression enclosed in parentheses always results in only one value.
          hus,
          <code>(f(x,y,z))</code> is always a single value,
          even if <code>f</code> returns several values.
          (he value of <code>(f(x,y,z))</code> is the first value returned by <code>f</code>
          or <b>nil</b> if <code>f</code> does not return any values.)



     <h3>2.5.1 - <a name="2.5.1">rithmetic Operators</a></h3>
     <p>
          Lua supports the usual arithmetic operators:
          the binary <code>+</code> (addition),
          <code>-</code> (subtraction), <code>*</code> (multiplication),
          <code>/</code> (division), <code>%</code> (modulo), and <code>^</code> (exponentiation);
          and unary <code>-</code> (negation).
          f the operands are numbers, or strings that can be converted to
          numbers (see <a href="#2.2.1">&sect;2.2.1</a>),
          then all operations have the usual meaning.
          Exponentiation works for any exponent.
          For instance, <code>x^(-0.5)</code> computes the inverse of the square root of <code>x</code>.
          Modulo is defined as

     <pre>
     a % b == a - math.floor(a/b)*b
</pre>
     <p>
          hat is, it is the remainder of a division that rounds
          the quotient towards minus infinity.





     <h3>2.5.2 - <a name="2.5.2">elational Operators</a></h3>
     <p>
          he relational operators in Lua are

     <pre>
     ==    !=    &lt;     &gt;     &lt;=    &gt;=
</pre>
     <p>
          hese operators always result in <b>false</b> or <b>true</b>.


     <p>
          Equality (<code>==</code>) first compares the type of its operands.
          f the types are different, then the result is <b>false</b>.
          Otherwise, the values of the operands are compared.
          umbers and strings are compared in the usual way.
          Objects (tables, userdata, threads, and functions)
          are compared by <em>reference</em>:
          two objects are considered equal only if they are the <em>same</em> object.
          Every time you create a new object
          (a table, userdata, thread, or function),
          this new object is different from any previously existing object.


     <p>
          ou can change the way that Lua compares tables and userdata
          by using the "eq" metamethod (see <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a>).


     <p>
          he conversion rules of <a href="#2.2.1">&sect;2.2.1</a>
          <em>do not</em> apply to equality comparisons.
          hus, <code>"0"==0</code> evaluates to <b>false</b>,
          and <code>t[0]</code> and <code>t["0"]</code> denote different
          entries in a table.


     <p>
          he operator <code>!=</code> is exactly the negation of equality (<code>==</code>).


     <p>
          he order operators work as follows.
          f both arguments are numbers, then they are compared as such.
          Otherwise, if both arguments are strings,
          then their values are compared according to the current locale.
          Otherwise, Lua tries to call the "lt" or the "le"
          metamethod (see <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a>).
           comparison <code>a &gt; b</code> is translated to <code>b &lt; a</code>
          and <code>a &gt;= b</code> is translated to <code>b &lt;= a</code>.





     <h3>2.5.3 - <a name="2.5.3">Logical Operators</a></h3>
     <p>
          he logical operators in Lua are
          <b>and</b>, <b>or</b>, and <b>not</b>.
          Like the control structures (see <a href="#2.4.4">&sect;2.4.4</a>),
          all logical operators consider both <b>false</b> and <b>nil</b> as false
          and anything else as true.


     <p>
          he negation operator <b>not</b> always returns <b>false</b> or <b>true</b>.
          he conjunction operator <b>and</b> returns its first argument
          if this value is <b>false</b> or <b>nil</b>;
          otherwise, <b>and</b> returns its second argument.
          he disjunction operator <b>or</b> returns its first argument
          if this value is different from <b>nil</b> and <b>false</b>;
          otherwise, <b>or</b> returns its second argument.
          Both <b>and</b> and <b>or</b> use short-cut evaluation;
          that is,
          the second operand is evaluated only if necessary.
          Here are some examples:

     <pre>
     10 or 20            --&gt; 10
     10 or error()       --&gt; 10
     nil or "a"          --&gt; "a"
     nil and 10          --&gt; nil
     false and error()   --&gt; false
     false and nil       --&gt; false
     false or nil        --&gt; nil
     10 and 20           --&gt; 20
</pre>
     <p>
          (n this manual,
          <code>--&gt;</code> indicates the result of the preceding expression.)





     <h3>2.5.4 - <a name="2.5.4">Concatenation</a></h3>
     <p>
          he string concatenation operator in Lua is
          denoted by two dots ('<code>..</code>').
          f both operands are strings or numbers, then they are converted to
          strings according to the rules mentioned in <a href="#2.2.1">&sect;2.2.1</a>.
          Otherwise, the "concat" metamethod is called (see <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a>).





     <h3>2.5.5 - <a name="2.5.5">he Length Operator</a></h3>

     <p>
          he length operator is denoted by the unary operator <code>#</code>.
          he length of a string is its number of bytes
          (that is, the usual meaning of string length when each
          character is one byte).


     <p>
          he length of a table <code>t</code> is defined to be any
          integer index <code>n</code>
          such that <code>t[n]</code> is not <b>nil</b> and <code>t[n+1]</code> is <b>nil</b>;
          moreover, if <code>t[1]</code> is <b>nil</b>, <code>n</code> can be zero.
          For a regular array, with non-nil values from 1 to a given <code>n</code>,
          its length is exactly that <code>n</code>,
          the index of its last value.
          f the array has "holes"
          (that is, <b>nil</b> values between other non-nil values),
          then <code>#t</code> can be any of the indices that
          directly precedes a <b>nil</b> value
          (that is, it may consider any such <b>nil</b> value as the end of
          the array).





     <h3>2.5.6 - <a name="2.5.6">Precedence</a></h3>
     <p>
          Operator precedence in Lua follows the table below,
          from lower to higher priority:

     <pre>
     or
     and
     &lt;     &gt;     &lt;=    &gt;=    !=    ==
     ..
     +     -
     *     /     %
     not   #     - (unary)
     ^
</pre>
     <p>
          s usual,
          you can use parentheses to change the precedences of an expression.
          he concatenation ('<code>..</code>') and exponentiation ('<code>^</code>')
          operators are right associative.
          ll other binary operators are left associative.





     <h3>2.5.7 - <a name="2.5.7">able Constructors</a></h3>
     <p>
          able constructors are expressions that create tables.
          Every time a constructor is evaluated, a new table is created.
           constructor can be used to create an empty table
          or to create a table and initialize some of its fields.
          he general syntax for constructors is

     <pre>
	tableconstructor ::= `<b>{</b>&acute; [fieldlist] `<b>}</b>&acute;
	fieldlist ::= field {fieldsep field} [fieldsep]
	field ::= `<b>[</b>&acute; exp `<b>]</b>&acute; `<b>=</b>&acute; exp | ame `<b>=</b>&acute; exp | exp
	fieldsep ::= `<b>,</b>&acute; | `<b>;</b>&acute;
</pre>

     <p>
          Each field of the form <code>[exp1] = exp2</code> adds to the new table an entry
          with key <code>exp1</code> and value <code>exp2</code>.
           field of the form <code>name = exp</code> is equivalent to
          <code>["name"] = exp</code>.
          Finally, fields of the form <code>exp</code> are equivalent to
          <code>[i] = exp</code>, where <code>i</code> are consecutive numerical integers,
          starting with 1.
          Fields in the other formats do not affect this counting.
          For example,

     <pre>
     a = { [f(1)] = g; "x", "y"; x = 1, f(x), [30] = 23; 45 }
</pre>
     <p>
          is equivalent to

     <pre>
     do
       local t = {}
       t[f(1)] = g
       t[1] = "x"         -- 1st exp
       t[2] = "y"         -- 2nd exp
       t.x = 1            -- t["x"] = 1
       t[3] = f(x)        -- 3rd exp
       t[30] = 23
       t[4] = 45          -- 4th exp
       a = t
     end
</pre>

     <p>
          f the last field in the list has the form <code>exp</code>
          and the expression is a function call or a vararg expression,
          then all values returned by this expression enter the list consecutively
          (see <a href="#2.5.8">&sect;2.5.8</a>).
          o avoid this,
          enclose the function call or the vararg expression
          in parentheses (see <a href="#2.5">&sect;2.5</a>).


     <p>
          he field list can have an optional trailing separator,
          as a convenience for machine-generated code.





     <h3>2.5.8 - <a name="2.5.8">Function Calls</a></h3>
     <p>
           function call in Lua has the following syntax:

     <pre>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp args
</pre>
     <p>
          n a function call,
          first prefixexp and args are evaluated.
          f the value of prefixexp has type <em>function</em>,
          then this function is called
          with the given arguments.
          Otherwise, the prefixexp "call" metamethod is called,
          having as first parameter the value of prefixexp,
          followed by the original call arguments
          (see <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a>).


     <p>
          he form

     <pre>
	functioncall ::= prefixexp `<b>:</b>&acute; ame args
</pre>
     <p>
          can be used to call "methods".
           call <code>v:name(<em>args</em>)</code>
          is syntactic sugar for <code>v.name(v,<em>args</em>)</code>,
          except that <code>v</code> is evaluated only once.


     <p>
          rguments have the following syntax:

     <pre>
	args ::= `<b>(</b>&acute; [explist] `<b>)</b>&acute;
	args ::= String
</pre>
     <p>
          ll argument expressions are evaluated before the call.
           call of the form <code>f'<em>string</em>'</code>
          (or <code>f"<em>string</em>"</code> or <code>f[[<em>string</em>]]</code>)
          is syntactic sugar for <code>f('<em>string</em>')</code>;
          that is, the argument list is a single literal string.


     <p>
          s an exception to the free-format syntax of Lua,
          you cannot put a line break before the '<code>(</code>' in a function call.
          his restriction avoids some ambiguities in the language.
          f you write

     <pre>
     a = f
     (g).x(a)
</pre>
     <p>
          Lua would see that as a single statement, <code>a = f(g).x(a)</code>.
          So, if you want two statements, you must add a semi-colon between them.
          f you actually want to call <code>f</code>,
          you must remove the line break before <code>(g)</code>.


     <p>
           call of the form <code>return</code> <em>functioncall</em> is called
          a <em>tail call</em>.
          Lua implements <em>proper tail calls</em>
          (or <em>proper tail recursion</em>):
          in a tail call,
          the called function reuses the stack entry of the calling function.
          herefore, there is no limit on the number of nested tail calls that
          a program can execute.
          However, a tail call erases any debug information about the
          calling function.
          ote that a tail call only happens with a particular syntax,
          where the <b>return</b> has one single function call as argument;
          this syntax makes the calling function return exactly
          the returns of the called function.
          So, none of the following examples are tail calls:

     <pre>
     return (f(x))        -- results adjusted to 1
     return 2 * f(x)
     return x, f(x)       -- additional results
     f(x); return         -- results discarded
     return x or f(x)     -- results adjusted to 1
</pre>




     <h3>2.5.9 - <a name="2.5.9">Function Definitions</a></h3>

     <p>
          he syntax for function definition is

     <pre>
	function ::= <b>function</b> funcbody
	funcbody ::= `<b>(</b>&acute; [parlist] `<b>)</b>&acute; block <b>end</b>
</pre>

     <p>
          he following syntactic sugar simplifies function definitions:

     <pre>
	stat ::= <b>function</b> funcname funcbody
	stat ::= <b>local</b> <b>function</b> ame funcbody
	funcname ::= ame {`<b>.</b>&acute; ame} [`<b>:</b>&acute; ame]
</pre>
     <p>
          he statement

     <pre>
     function f () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          translates to

     <pre>
     f = function () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          he statement

     <pre>
     function t.a.b.c.f () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          translates to

     <pre>
     t.a.b.c.f = function () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          he statement

     <pre>
     local function f () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          translates to

     <pre>
     local f; f = function () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          <em>not</em> to

     <pre>
     local f = function () <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          (his only makes a difference when the body of the function
          contains references to <code>f</code>.)


     <p>
           function definition is an executable expression,
          whose value has type <em>function</em>.
          When Lua pre-compiles a chunk,
          all its function bodies are pre-compiled too.
          hen, whenever Lua executes the function definition,
          the function is <em>instantiated</em> (or <em>closed</em>).
          his function instance (or <em>closure</em>)
          is the final value of the expression.
          Different instances of the same function
          can refer to different external local variables
          and can have different environment tables.


     <p>
          Parameters act as local variables that are
          initialized with the argument values:

     <pre>
	parlist ::= namelist [`<b>,</b>&acute; `<b>...</b>&acute;] | `<b>...</b>&acute;
</pre>
     <p>
          When a function is called,
          the list of arguments is adjusted to
          the length of the list of parameters,
          unless the function is a variadic or <em>vararg function</em>,
          which is
          indicated by three dots ('<code>...</code>') at the end of its parameter list.
           vararg function does not adjust its argument list;
          instead, it collects all extra arguments and supplies them
          to the function through a <em>vararg expression</em>,
          which is also written as three dots.
          he value of this expression is a list of all actual extra arguments,
          similar to a function with multiple results.
          f a vararg expression is used inside another expression
          or in the middle of a list of expressions,
          then its return list is adjusted to one element.
          f the expression is used as the last element of a list of expressions,
          then no adjustment is made
          (unless that last expression is enclosed in parentheses).


     <p>
          s an example, consider the following definitions:

     <pre>
     function f(a, b) end
     function g(a, b, ...) end
     function r() return 1,2,3 end
</pre>
     <p>
          hen, we have the following mapping from arguments to parameters and
          to the vararg expression:

     <pre>
     CLL            PMEES
     
     f(3)             a=3, b=nil
     f(3, 4)          a=3, b=4
     f(3, 4, 5)       a=3, b=4
     f(r(), 10)       a=1, b=10
     f(r())           a=1, b=2
     
     g(3)             a=3, b=nil, ... --&gt;  (nothing)
     g(3, 4)          a=3, b=4,   ... --&gt;  (nothing)
     g(3, 4, 5, 8)    a=3, b=4,   ... --&gt;  5  8
     g(5, r())        a=5, b=1,   ... --&gt;  2  3
</pre>

     <p>
          esults are returned using the <b>return</b> statement (see <a href="#2.4.4">&sect;2.4.4</a>).
          f control reaches the end of a function
          without encountering a <b>return</b> statement,
          then the function returns with no results.


     <p>
          he <em>colon</em> syntax
          is used for defining <em>methods</em>,
          that is, functions that have an implicit extra parameter <code>self</code>.
          hus, the statement

     <pre>
     function t.a.b.c:f (<em>params</em>) <em>body</em> end
</pre>
     <p>
          is syntactic sugar for

     <pre>
     t.a.b.c.f = function (self, <em>params</em>) <em>body</em> end
</pre>






     <h2>2.6 - <a name="2.6">isibility ules</a></h2>

     <p>

          Lua is a lexically scoped language.
          he scope of variables begins at the first statement <em>after</em>
          their declaration and lasts until the end of the innermost block that
          includes the declaration.
          Consider the following example:

     <pre>
     x = 10                -- global variable
     do                    -- new block
       local x = x         -- new 'x', with value 10
       print(x)            --&gt; 10
       x = x+1
       do                  -- another block
         local x = x+1     -- another 'x'
         print(x)          --&gt; 12
       end
       print(x)            --&gt; 11
     end
     print(x)              --&gt; 10  (the global one)
</pre>

     <p>
          otice that, in a declaration like <code>local x = x</code>,
          the new <code>x</code> being declared is not in scope yet,
          and so the second <code>x</code> refers to the outside variable.


     <p>
          Because of the lexical scoping rules,
          local variables can be freely accessed by functions
          defined inside their scope.
           local variable used by an inner function is called
          an <em>upvalue</em>, or <em>external local variable</em>,
          inside the inner function.


     <p>
          otice that each execution of a <b>local</b> statement
          defines new local variables.
          Consider the following example:

     <pre>
     a = {}
     local x = 20
     for i=1,10 do
       local y = 0
       a[i] = function () y=y+1; return x+y end
     end
</pre>
     <p>
          he loop creates ten closures
          (that is, ten instances of the anonymous function).
          Each of these closures uses a different <code>y</code> variable,
          while all of them share the same <code>x</code>.





     <h2>2.7 - <a name="2.7">Error Handling</a></h2>

     <p>
          Because Lua is an embedded extension language,
          all Lua actions start from C&nbsp;code in the host program
          calling a function from the Lua library (see <a href="#lua_pcall"><code>lua_pcall</code></a>).
          Whenever an error occurs during Lua compilation or execution,
          control returns to C,
          which can take appropriate measures
          (such as printing an error message).


     <p>
          Lua code can explicitly generate an error by calling the
          <a href="#pdf-error"><code>error</code></a> function.
          f you need to catch errors in Lua,
          you can use the <a href="#pdf-pcall"><code>pcall</code></a> function.










     <h2>2.9 - <a name="2.9">Environments</a></h2>

     <p>
          Besides metatables,
          objects of types thread, function, and userdata
          have another table associated with them,
          called their <em>environment</em>.
          Like metatables, environments are regular tables and
          multiple objects can share the same environment.


     <p>
          hreads are created sharing the environment of the creating thread.
          Userdata and C&nbsp;functions are created sharing the environment
          of the creating C&nbsp;function.
          on-nested Lua functions
          (created by <a href="#pdf-loadfile"><code>loadfile</code></a>, <a
               href="#pdf-loadstring"><code>loadstring</code></a> or <a href="#pdf-load"><code>load</code></a>)
          are created sharing the environment of the creating thread.
          ested Lua functions are created sharing the environment of
          the creating Lua function.


     <p>
          Environments associated with userdata have no meaning for Lua.
          t is only a convenience feature for programmers to associate a table to
          a userdata.


     <p>
          Environments associated with threads are called
          <em>global environments</em>.
          hey are used as the default environment for threads and
          non-nested Lua functions created by the thread
          and can be directly accessed by C&nbsp;code (see <a href="#3.3">&sect;3.3</a>).

          t is used as the default environment for other C&nbsp;functions
          and userdata created by the function.


     <p>
          Environments associated with Lua functions are used to resolve
          all accesses to global variables within the function (see <a href="#2.3">&sect;2.3</a>).

     <h2>2.10 - <a name="2.10">arbage Collection</a></h2>

     <p>
          Lua performs automatic memory management.
          his means that
          you have to worry neither about allocating memory for new objects
          nor about freeing it when the objects are no longer needed.
          Lua manages memory automatically by running
          a <em>garbage collector</em> from time to time
          to collect all <em>dead objects</em>
          (that is, objects that are no longer accessible from Lua).
          ll memory used by Lua is subject to automatic management:
          tables, userdata, functions, threads, strings, etc.


     <p>
          Lua implements an incremental mark-and-sweep collector.
          t uses two numbers to control its garbage-collection cycles:
          the <em>garbage-collector pause</em> and
          the <em>garbage-collector step multiplier</em>.
          Both use percentage points as units
          (so that a value of 100 means an internal value of 1).


     <p>
          he garbage-collector pause
          controls how long the collector waits before starting a new cycle.
          Larger values make the collector less aggressive.
          alues smaller than 100 mean the collector will not wait to
          start a new cycle.
           value of 200 means that the collector waits for the total memory in use
          to double before starting a new cycle.


     <p>
          he step multiplier
          controls the relative speed of the collector relative to
          memory allocation.
          Larger values make the collector more aggressive but also increase
          the size of each incremental step.
          alues smaller than 100 make the collector too slow and
          can result in the collector never finishing a cycle.
          he default, 200, means that the collector runs at "twice"
          the speed of memory allocation.


     <p>
          ou can change these numbers by calling <a href="#lua_gc"><code>lua_gc</code></a> in C
          or <a href="#pdf-collectgarbage"><code>collectgarbage</code></a> in Lua.
          With these functions you can also control
          the collector directly (e.g., stop and restart it).



     <h3>2.10.1 - <a name="2.10.1">arbage-Collection Metamethods</a></h3>

     <p>
          Using the C&nbsp;P,
          you can set garbage-collector metamethods for userdata (see <a href="#2.8">&sect;2.8</a>).
          hese metamethods are also called <em>finalizers</em>.
          Finalizers allow you to coordinate Lua's garbage collection
          with external resource management
          (such as closing files, network or database connections,
          or freeing your own memory).


     <p>
          arbage userdata with a field <code>__gc</code> in their metatables are not
          collected immediately by the garbage collector.
          nstead, Lua puts them in a list.
          fter the collection,
          Lua does the equivalent of the following function
          for each userdata in that list:

     <pre>
     function gc_event (udata)
       local h = metatable(udata).__gc
       if h then
         h(udata)
       end
     end
</pre>

     <p>
          t the end of each garbage-collection cycle,
          the finalizers for userdata are called in <em>reverse</em>
          order of their creation,
          among those collected in that cycle.
          hat is, the first finalizer to be called is the one associated
          with the userdata created last in the program.
          he userdata itself is freed only in the next garbage-collection cycle.





     <h3>2.10.2 - <a name="2.10.2">Weak ables</a></h3>

     <p>
           <em>weak table</em> is a table whose elements are
          <em>weak references</em>.
           weak reference is ignored by the garbage collector.
          n other words,
          if the only references to an object are weak references,
          then the garbage collector will collect this object.


     <p>
           weak table can have weak keys, weak values, or both.
           table with weak keys allows the collection of its keys,
          but prevents the collection of its values.
           table with both weak keys and weak values allows the collection of
          both keys and values.
          n any case, if either the key or the value is collected,
          the whole pair is removed from the table.
          he weakness of a table is controlled by the
          <code>__mode</code> field of its metatable.
          f the <code>__mode</code> field is a string containing the character&nbsp;'<code>k</code>',
          the keys in the table are weak.
          f <code>__mode</code> contains '<code>v</code>',
          the values in the table are weak.


     <p>
          fter you use a table as a metatable,
          you should not change the value of its <code>__mode</code> field.
          Otherwise, the weak behavior of the tables controlled by this
          metatable is undefined.







     <h2>2.11 - <a name="2.11">Coroutines</a></h2>

     <p>
          Lua supports coroutines,
          also called <em>collaborative multithreading</em>.
           coroutine in Lua represents an independent thread of execution.
          Unlike threads in multithread systems, however,
          a coroutine only suspends its execution by explicitly calling
          a yield function.


     <p>
          ou create a coroutine with a call to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.create"><code>coroutine.create</code></a>.
          ts sole argument is a function
          that is the main function of the coroutine.
          he <code>create</code> function only creates a new coroutine and
          returns a handle to it (an object of type <em>thread</em>);
          it does not start the coroutine execution.


     <p>
          When you first call <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>,
          passing as its first argument
          a thread returned by <a href="#pdf-coroutine.create"><code>coroutine.create</code></a>,
          the coroutine starts its execution,
          at the first line of its main function.
          Extra arguments passed to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> are passed on
          to the coroutine main function.
          fter the coroutine starts running,
          it runs until it terminates or <em>yields</em>.


     <p>
           coroutine can terminate its execution in two ways:
          normally, when its main function returns
          (explicitly or implicitly, after the last instruction);
          and abnormally, if there is an unprotected error.
          n the first case, <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> returns <b>true</b>,
          plus any values returned by the coroutine main function.
          n case of errors, <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> returns <b>false</b>
          plus an error message.


     <p>
           coroutine yields by calling <a href="#pdf-coroutine.yield"><code>coroutine.yield</code></a>.
          When a coroutine yields,
          the corresponding <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> returns immediately,
          even if the yield happens inside nested function calls
          (that is, not in the main function,
          but in a function directly or indirectly called by the main function).
          n the case of a yield, <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a> also returns
          <b>true</b>,
          plus any values passed to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.yield"><code>coroutine.yield</code></a>.
          he next time you resume the same coroutine,
          it continues its execution from the point where it yielded,
          with the call to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.yield"><code>coroutine.yield</code></a> returning any extra
          arguments passed to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>.


     <p>
          Like <a href="#pdf-coroutine.create"><code>coroutine.create</code></a>,
          the <a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a> function also creates a coroutine,
          but instead of returning the coroutine itself,
          it returns a function that, when called, resumes the coroutine.
          ny arguments passed to this function
          go as extra arguments to <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>.
          <a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a> returns all the values returned by <a
               href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>,
          except the first one (the boolean error code).
          Unlike <a href="#pdf-coroutine.resume"><code>coroutine.resume</code></a>,
          <a href="#pdf-coroutine.wrap"><code>coroutine.wrap</code></a> does not catch errors;
          any error is propagated to the caller.


     <p>
          s an example,
          consider the following code:

     <pre>
     function foo (a)
       print("foo", a)
       return coroutine.yield(2*a)
     end
     
     co = coroutine.create(function (a,b)
           print("co-body", a, b)
           local r = foo(a+1)
           print("co-body", r)
           local r, s = coroutine.yield(a+b, a-b)
           print("co-body", r, s)
           return b, "end"
     end)
            
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, 1, 10))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "r"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
     print("main", coroutine.resume(co, "x", "y"))
</pre>
     <p>
          When you run it, it produces the following output:

     <pre>
     co-body 1       10
     foo     2
     
     main    true    4
     co-body r
     main    true    11      -9
     co-body x       y
     main    true    10      end
     main    false   cannot resume dead coroutine
</pre>




     <h1>3 - <a name="3">he pplication Program nterface</a></h1>

     <p>

          his section describes the C&nbsp;P for Lua, that is,
          the set of C&nbsp;functions available to the host program to communicate
          with Lua.
          ll P functions and related types and constants
          are declared in the header file <a name="pdf-lua.h"><code>lua.h</code></a>.


     <p>
          Even when we use the term "function",
          any facility in the P may be provided as a macro instead.
          ll such macros use each of their arguments exactly once
          (except for the first argument, which is always a Lua state),
          and so do not generate any hidden side-effects.


     <p>
          s in most C&nbsp;libraries,
          the Lua P functions do not check their arguments for validity or consistency.
          However, you can change this behavior by compiling Lua
          with a proper definition for the macro <a name="pdf-luai_apicheck"><code>luai_apicheck</code></a>,
          in file <code>luaconf.h</code>.



     <h2>3.1 - <a name="3.1">he Stack</a></h2>

     <p>
          Lua uses a <em>virtual stack</em> to pass values to and from C.
          Each element in this stack represents a Lua value
          (<b>nil</b>, number, string, etc.).


     <p>
          Whenever Lua calls C, the called function gets a new stack,
          which is independent of previous stacks and of stacks of
          C&nbsp;functions that are still active.
          his stack initially contains any arguments to the C&nbsp;function
          and it is where the C&nbsp;function pushes its results
          to be returned to the caller (see <a href="#lua_CFunction"><code>lua_CFunction</code></a>).


     <p>
          For convenience,
          most query operations in the P do not follow a strict stack discipline.
          nstead, they can refer to any element in the stack
          by using an <em>index</em>:
           positive index represents an <em>absolute</em> stack position
          (starting at&nbsp;1);
          a negative index represents an <em>offset</em> relative to the top of the stack.
          More specifically, if the stack has <em>n</em> elements,
          then index&nbsp;1 represents the first element
          (that is, the element that was pushed onto the stack first)
          and
          index&nbsp;<em>n</em> represents the last element;
          index&nbsp;-1 also represents the last element
          (that is, the element at the&nbsp;top)
          and index <em>-n</em> represents the first element.
          We say that an index is <em>valid</em>
          if it lies between&nbsp;1 and the stack top
          (that is, if <code>1 &le; abs(index) &le; top</code>).






     <h2>3.2 - <a name="3.2">Stack Size</a></h2>

     <p>
          When you interact with Lua P,
          you are responsible for ensuring consistency.
          n particular,
          <em>you are responsible for controlling stack overflow</em>.
          ou can use the function <a href="#lua_checkstack"><code>lua_checkstack</code></a>
          to grow the stack size.


     <p>
          Whenever Lua calls C,
          it ensures that at least <a name="pdf-LU_MSCK"><code>LU_MSCK</code></a> stack positions are
          available.
          <code>LU_MSCK</code> is defined as 20,
          so that usually you do not have to worry about stack space
          unless your code has loops pushing elements onto the stack.


     <p>
          Most query functions accept as indices any value inside the
          available stack space, that is, indices up to the maximum stack size
          you have set through <a href="#lua_checkstack"><code>lua_checkstack</code></a>.
          Such indices are called <em>acceptable indices</em>.
          More formally, we define an <em>acceptable index</em>
          as follows:

     <pre>
     (index &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; abs(index) &lt;= top) ||
     (index &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; index &lt;= stackspace)
</pre>
     <p>
          ote that 0 is never an acceptable index.





     <h2>3.3 - <a name="3.3">Pseudo-ndices</a></h2>

     <p>
          Unless otherwise noted,
          any function that accepts valid indices can also be called with
          <em>pseudo-indices</em>,
          which represent some Lua values that are accessible to C&nbsp;code
          but which are not in the stack.
          Pseudo-indices are used to access the thread environment,
          the function environment,
          the registry,
          and the upvalues of a C&nbsp;function (see <a href="#3.4">&sect;3.4</a>).


     <p>
          he thread environment (where global variables live) is
          always at pseudo-index <a name="pdf-LU_LOBLSDEX"><code>LU_LOBLSDEX</code></a>.
          he environment of the running C&nbsp;function is always
          at pseudo-index <a name="pdf-LU_EODEX"><code>LU_EODEX</code></a>.


     <p>
          o access and change the value of global variables,
          you can use regular table operations over an environment table.
          For instance, to access the value of a global variable, do

     <pre>
     lua_getfield(L, LU_LOBLSDEX, varname);
</pre>




     <h2>3.4 - <a name="3.4">C Closures</a></h2>

     <p>
          When a C&nbsp;function is created,
          it is possible to associate some values with it,
          thus creating a <em>C&nbsp;closure</em>;
          these values are called <em>upvalues</em> and are
          accessible to the function whenever it is called
          (see <a href="#lua_pushcclosure"><code>lua_pushcclosure</code></a>).


     <p>
          Whenever a C&nbsp;function is called,
          its upvalues are located at specific pseudo-indices.
          hese pseudo-indices are produced by the macro
          <a name="lua_upvalueindex"><code>lua_upvalueindex</code></a>.
          he first value associated with a function is at position
          <code>lua_upvalueindex(1)</code>, and so on.
          ny access to <code>lua_upvalueindex(<em>n</em>)</code>,
          where <em>n</em> is greater than the number of upvalues of the
          current function (but not greater than 256),
          produces an acceptable (but invalid) index.





     <h2>3.5 - <a name="3.5">egistry</a></h2>

     <p>
          Lua provides a <em>registry</em>,
          a pre-defined table that can be used by any C&nbsp;code to
          store whatever Lua value it needs to store.
          his table is always located at pseudo-index
          <a name="pdf-LU_ESDEX"><code>LU_ESDEX</code></a>.
          ny C&nbsp;library can store data into this table,
          but it should take care to choose keys different from those used
          by other libraries, to avoid collisions.
          ypically, you should use as key a string containing your library name
          or a light userdata with the address of a C&nbsp;object in your code.


     <p>
          he integer keys in the registry are used by the reference mechanism,
          implemented by the auxiliary library,
          and therefore should not be used for other purposes.





     <h2>3.6 - <a name="3.6">Error Handling in C</a></h2>

     <p>
          nternally, Lua uses the C <code>longjmp</code> facility to handle errors.
          (ou can also choose to use exceptions if you use C++;
          see file <code>luaconf.h</code>.)
          When Lua faces any error
          (such as memory allocation errors, type errors, syntax errors,
          and runtime errors)
          it <em>raises</em> an error;
          that is, it does a long jump.
           <em>protected environment</em> uses <code>setjmp</code>
          to set a recover point;
          any error jumps to the most recent active recover point.


     <p>
          Most functions in the P can throw an error,
          for instance due to a memory allocation error.
          he documentation for each function indicates whether
          it can throw errors.


     <p>
          nside a C&nbsp;function you can throw an error by calling <a href="#lua_error"><code>lua_error</code></a>.





     <h2>3.7 - <a name="3.7">Functions and ypes</a></h2>

     <p>
          Here we list all functions and types from the C&nbsp;P in
          alphabetical order.
          Each function has an indicator like this:
          <span class="apii">[-o, +p, <em>x</em>]</span>


     <p>
          he first field, <code>o</code>,
          is how many elements the function pops from the stack.
          he second field, <code>p</code>,
          is how many elements the function pushes onto the stack.
          (ny function always pushes its results after popping its arguments.)
           field in the form <code>x|y</code> means the function can push (or pop)
          <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> elements,
          depending on the situation;
          an interrogation mark '<code>?</code>' means that
          we cannot know how many elements the function pops/pushes
          by looking only at its arguments
          (e.g., they may depend on what is on the stack).
          he third field, <code>x</code>,
          tells whether the function may throw errors:
          '<code>-</code>' means the function never throws any error;
          '<code>m</code>' means the function may throw an error
          only due to not enough memory;
          '<code>e</code>' means the function may throw other kinds of errors;
          '<code>v</code>' means the function may throw an error on purpose.

          the allocator should behave like <code>malloc</code>.
          When <code>nsize</code> and <code>osize</code> are not zero,
          the allocator behaves like <code>realloc</code>.
          Lua assumes that the allocator never fails when
          <code>osize &gt;= nsize</code>.


     <p>
          Here is a simple implementation for the allocator function.
          t is used in the auxiliary library by <a href="#luaL_newstate"><code>luaL_newstate</code></a>.

     <pre>
     static void *l_alloc (void *ud, void *ptr, size_t osize,
                                                size_t nsize) {
       (void)ud;  (void)osize;  /* not used */
       if (nsize == 0) {
         free(ptr);
         return ULL;
       }
       else
         return realloc(ptr, nsize);
     }
</pre>
     <p>
          his code assumes
          that <code>free(ULL)</code> has no effect and that
          <code>realloc(ULL, size)</code> is equivalent to <code>malloc(size)</code>.
          S&nbsp;C ensures both behaviors.

          Lua calls a <em>panic function</em>
          and then calls <code>exit(EX_FLUE)</code>,
          thus exiting the host application.
          our panic function can avoid this exit by
          never returning (e.g., doing a long jump).

          he panic function can access the error message at the top of the stack.

     <pre>void lua_call (lua_State *L, int nargs, int nresults);</pre>

     <p>
          Calls a function.


     <p>
          o call a function you must use the following protocol:
          first, the function to be called is pushed onto the stack;
          then, the arguments to the function are pushed
          in direct order;
          that is, the first argument is pushed first.
          Finally you call <a href="#lua_call"><code>lua_call</code></a>;
          <code>nargs</code> is the number of arguments that you pushed onto the stack.
          ll arguments and the function value are popped from the stack
          when the function is called.
          he function results are pushed onto the stack when the function returns.
          he number of results is adjusted to <code>nresults</code>,
          unless <code>nresults</code> is <a name="pdf-LU_MULE"><code>LU_MULE</code></a>.
          n this case, <em>all</em> results from the function are pushed.
          Lua takes care that the returned values fit into the stack space.
          he function results are pushed onto the stack in direct order
          (the first result is pushed first),
          so that after the call the last result is on the top of the stack.


     <p>
          ny error inside the called function is propagated upwards
          (with a <code>longjmp</code>).


     <p>
          he following example shows how the host program can do the
          equivalent to this Lua code:

     <pre>
     a = f("how", t.x, 14)
</pre>
     <p>
          Here it is in&nbsp;C:

     <pre>
     lua_getfield(L, LU_LOBLSDEX, "f"); /* function to be called */
     lua_pushstring(L, "how");                        /* 1st argument */
     lua_getfield(L, LU_LOBLSDEX, "t");   /* table to be indexed */
     lua_getfield(L, -1, "x");        /* push result of t.x (2nd arg) */
     lua_remove(L, -2);                  /* remove 't' from the stack */
     lua_pushinteger(L, 14);                          /* 3rd argument */
     lua_call(L, 3, 1);     /* call 'f' with 3 arguments and 1 result */
     lua_setfield(L, LU_LOBLSDEX, "a");        /* set global 'a' */
</pre>
     <p>
          ote that the code above is "balanced":
          at its end, the stack is back to its original configuration.
          his is considered good programming practice.

          ype for C&nbsp;functions.


     <p>
          n order to communicate properly with Lua,
          a C&nbsp;function must use the following protocol,
          which defines the way parameters and results are passed:
          a C&nbsp;function receives its arguments from Lua in its stack
          in direct order (the first argument is pushed first).
          So, when the function starts,
          <code>lua_gettop(L)</code> returns the number of arguments received by the function.
          he first argument (if any) is at index 1
          and its last argument is at index <code>lua_gettop(L)</code>.
          o return values to Lua, a C&nbsp;function just pushes them onto the stack,
          in direct order (the first result is pushed first),
          and returns the number of results.
          ny other value in the stack below the results will be properly
          discarded by Lua.
          Like a Lua function, a C&nbsp;function called by Lua can also return
          many results.


     <p>
          s an example, the following function receives a variable number
          of numerical arguments and returns their average and sum:

     <pre>
     static int foo (lua_State *L) {
       int n = lua_gettop(L);    /* number of arguments */
       lua_umber sum = 0;
       int i;
       for (i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++) {
         if (!lua_isnumber(L, i)) {
           lua_pushstring(L, "incorrect argument");
           lua_error(L);
         }
         sum += lua_tonumber(L, i);
       }
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum/n);        /* first result */
       lua_pushnumber(L, sum);         /* second result */
       return 2;                   /* number of results */
     }

          Userdata represent C&nbsp;values in Lua.

          t is an object (like a table):

           full userdata is only equal to itself (under raw equality).


     <p>
          When Lua collects a full userdata with a <code>gc</code> metamethod,
          Lua calls the metamethod and marks the userdata as finalized.

               then <code>source</code> is that string.
               f the function was defined in a file,

               a "printable" version of <code>source</code>, to be used in error messages.
          </li>

          </li>

          <li><b><code>lastlinedefined</code>:</b>
               the line number where the definition of the function ends.
          </li>

          <li><b><code>what</code>:</b>
               the string <code>"Lua"</code> if the function is a Lua function,
               <code>"C"</code> if it is a C&nbsp;function,
               <code>"main"</code> if it is the main part of a chunk,

               n the latter case,
               Lua has no other information about the function.
          </li>

          <li><b><code>name</code>:</b>
               a reasonable name for the given function.
               Because functions in Lua are first-class values,
               they do not have a fixed name:
               some functions can be the value of multiple global variables,
               while others can be stored only in a table field.
               he <code>lua_getinfo</code> function checks how the function was

               (Lua uses the empty string when no other option seems to apply.)
          </li>

          <li><b><code>nups</code>:</b>
               the number of upvalues of the function.

          n the latter case, Lua is simulating a return from
          a function that did a tail call;
          in this case, it is useless to call <a href="#lua_getinfo"><code>lua_getinfo</code></a>.


     <p>
          While Lua is running a hook, it disables other calls to hooks.
          herefore, if a hook calls back Lua to execute a function or a chunk,
          this execution occurs without any calls to hooks.

          </li>

          <li><b>he return hook:</b> is called when the interpreter returns from a function.
               he hook is called just before Lua leaves the function.
               ou have no access to the values to be returned by the function.
          </li>

          <li><b>he line hook:</b> is called when the interpreter is about to
               start the execution of a new line of code,
               or when it jumps back in the code (even to the same line).
               (his event only happens while Lua is executing a Lua function.)
          </li>

     <h1>4 - <a name="4">he uxiliary Library</a></h1>

     <p>

          he <em>auxiliary library</em> provides several convenient functions
          to interface C with Lua.
          While the basic P provides the primitive functions for all
          interactions between C and Lua,
          the auxiliary library provides higher-level functions for some
          common tasks.


     <p>
          ll functions from the auxiliary library
          are defined in header file <code>lauxlib.h</code> and
          have a prefix <code>luaL_</code>.


     <p>
          ll functions in the auxiliary library are built on
          top of the basic P,
          and so they provide nothing that cannot be done with this P.


     <p>
          Several functions in the auxiliary library are used to
          check C&nbsp;function arguments.
          heir names are always <code>luaL_check*</code> or <code>luaL_opt*</code>.
          ll of these functions throw an error if the check is not satisfied.
          Because the error message is formatted for arguments
          (e.g., "<code>bad argument #1</code>"),
          you should not use these functions for other stack values.



     <h2>4.1 - <a name="4.1">Functions and ypes</a></h2>

          ype for a <em>string buffer</em>.


     <p>
           string buffer allows C&nbsp;code to build Lua strings piecemeal.
          ts pattern of use is as follows:

     <ul>

          <li>First you declare a variable <code>b</code> of type <a href="#luaL_Buffer"><code>luaL_Buffer</code></a>.
          </li>

          <li>hen you initialize it with a call <code>luaL_buffinit(L, &amp;b)</code>.</li>

          <li>
               hen you add string pieces to the buffer calling any of
               the <code>luaL_add*</code> functions.
          </li>

          <li>
               ou finish by calling <code>luaL_pushresult(&amp;b)</code>.
               his call leaves the final string on the top of the stack.
          </li>

     </ul>

     <p>
          During its normal operation,
          a string buffer uses a variable number of stack slots.
          So, while using a buffer, you cannot assume that you know where
          the top of the stack is.
          ou can use the stack between successive calls to buffer operations
          as long as that use is balanced;
          that is,
          when you call a buffer operation,
          the stack is at the same level
          it was immediately after the previous buffer operation.
          (he only exception to this rule is <a href="#luaL_addvalue"><code>luaL_addvalue</code></a>.)
          fter calling <a href="#luaL_pushresult"><code>luaL_pushresult</code></a> the stack is back to its
          level when the buffer was initialized,
          plus the final string on its top.

     <h1>5 - <a name="5">Standard Libraries</a></h1>

     <p>
          he standard Lua libraries provide useful functions
          that are implemented directly through the C&nbsp;P.
          Some of these functions provide essential services to the language
          (e.g., <a href="#pdf-type"><code>type</code></a>);
          others provide access to "outside" services (e.g., /O);
          and others could be implemented in Lua itself,
          but are quite useful or have critical performance requirements that
          deserve an implementation in C (e.g., <a href="#pdf-table.sort"><code>table.sort</code></a>).


     <p>
          ll libraries are implemented through the official C&nbsp;P
          and are provided as separate C&nbsp;modules.
          Currently, Lua has the following standard libraries:

     <ul>

          <li>basic library, which includes the coroutine sub-library;</li>

          <li>package library;</li>

          <li>string manipulation;</li>

          <li>table manipulation;</li>

          <li>mathematical functions (sin, log, etc.);</li>

          <li>input and output;</li>

          <li>operating system facilities;</li>

          <li>debug facilities.</li>

     </ul>
     <p>
          Except for the basic and package libraries,
          each library provides all its functions as fields of a global table
          or as methods of its objects.


     <p>
          o have access to these libraries,
          the C&nbsp;host program should call the <a href="#luaL_openlibs"><code>luaL_openlibs</code></a> function,

          facilities for loading and building modules in Lua.
          t exports two of its functions directly in the global environment:
          <a href="#pdf-require"><code>require</code></a> and <a href="#pdf-module"><code>module</code></a>.
          Everything else is exported in a table <a name="pdf-package"><code>package</code></a>.

          f there is a table in <code>package.loaded[name]</code>,
          this table is the module.
          Otherwise, if there is a global table <code>t</code> with the given name,
          this table is the module.
          Otherwise creates a new table <code>t</code> and
          sets it as the value of the global <code>name</code> and
          the value of <code>package.loaded[name]</code>.
          his function also initializes <code>t._ME</code> with the given name,
          <code>t._M</code> with the module (<code>t</code> itself),
          and <code>t._PCKE</code> with the package name
          (the full module name minus last component; see below).
          Finally, <code>module</code> sets <code>t</code> as the new environment
          of the current function and the new value of <code>package.loaded[name]</code>,
          so that <a href="#pdf-require"><code>require</code></a> returns <code>t</code>.

          f <code>name</code> is a compound name
          (that is, one with components separated by dots),
          <code>module</code> creates (or reuses, if they already exist)
          tables for each component.
          For instance, if <code>name</code> is <code>a.b.c</code>,

     <h3><a name="pdf-require"><code>require (modname)</code></a></h3>


     <p>
          Loads the given module.
          he function starts by looking into the <a href="#pdf-package.loaded"><code>package.loaded</code></a> table
          to determine whether <code>modname</code> is already loaded.
          f it is, then <code>require</code> returns the value stored
          at <code>package.loaded[modname]</code>.
          Otherwise, it tries to find a <em>loader</em> for the module.


     <p>
          o find a loader,
          <code>require</code> is guided by the <a href="#pdf-package.loaders"><code>package.loaders</code></a> array.
          By changing this array,
          we can change how <code>require</code> looks for a module.
          he following explanation is based on the default configuration
          for <a href="#pdf-package.loaders"><code>package.loaders</code></a>.


     <p>
          First <code>require</code> queries <code>package.preload[modname]</code>.
          f it has a value,
          this value (which should be a function) is the loader.
          Otherwise <code>require</code> searches for a Lua loader using the
          path stored in <a href="#pdf-package.path"><code>package.path</code></a>.
          f that also fails, it searches for a C&nbsp;loader using the
          path stored in <a href="#pdf-package.cpath"><code>package.cpath</code></a>.
          f that also fails,
          it tries an <em>all-in-one</em> loader (see <a href="#pdf-package.loaders"><code>package.loaders</code></a>).


     <p>
          Once a loader is found,
          <code>require</code> calls the loader with a single argument, <code>modname</code>.
          f the loader returns any value,
          <code>require</code> assigns the returned value to <code>package.loaded[modname]</code>.
          f the loader returns no value and
          has not assigned any value to <code>package.loaded[modname]</code>,
          then <code>require</code> assigns <b>true</b> to this entry.
          n any case, <code>require</code> returns the
          final value of <code>package.loaded[modname]</code>.


     <p>
          f there is any error loading or running the module,
          or if it cannot find any loader for the module,
          then <code>require</code> signals an error.

     <p>
          Lua initializes the C&nbsp;path <a href="#pdf-package.cpath"><code>package.cpath</code></a> in the same way
          it initializes the Lua path <a href="#pdf-package.path"><code>package.path</code></a>,

          modules are already loaded.
          When you require a module <code>modname</code> and
          <code>package.loaded[modname]</code> is not false,
          <a href="#pdf-require"><code>require</code></a> simply returns the value stored there.

     <p>
           table used by <a href="#pdf-require"><code>require</code></a> to control how to load modules.


     <p>
          Each entry in this table is a <em>searcher function</em>.
          When looking for a module,
          <a href="#pdf-require"><code>require</code></a> calls each of these searchers in ascending order,
          with the module name (the argument given to <a href="#pdf-require"><code>require</code></a>) as its
          sole parameter.
          he function can return another function (the module <em>loader</em>)
          or a string explaining why it did not find that module
          (or <b>nil</b> if it has nothing to say).
          Lua initializes this table with four functions.


     <p>
          he first searcher simply looks for a loader in the
          <a href="#pdf-package.preload"><code>package.preload</code></a> table.


     <p>
          he second searcher looks for a loader as a Lua library,
          using the path stored at <a href="#pdf-package.path"><code>package.path</code></a>.
           path is a sequence of <em>templates</em> separated by semicolons.
          For each template,
          the searcher will change each interrogation
          mark in the template by <code>filename</code>,
          which is the module name with each dot replaced by a
          "directory separator" (such as "<code>/</code>" in Unix);
          then it will try to open the resulting file name.
          So, for instance, if the Lua path is the string

     <pre>
     "./?.lua;./?.lc;/usr/local/?/init.lua"
</pre>
     <p>
          the search for a Lua file for module <code>foo</code>
          will try to open the files
          <code>./foo.lua</code>, <code>./foo.lc</code>, and
          <code>/usr/local/foo/init.lua</code>, in that order.


     <p>
          he third searcher looks for a loader as a C&nbsp;library,
          using the path given by the variable <a href="#pdf-package.cpath"><code>package.cpath</code></a>.
          For instance,
          if the C&nbsp;path is the string

     <pre>
     "./?.so;./?.dll;/usr/local/?/init.so"
</pre>
     <p>
          the searcher for module <code>foo</code>
          will try to open the files <code>./foo.so</code>, <code>./foo.dll</code>,
          and <code>/usr/local/foo/init.so</code>, in that order.
          Once it finds a C&nbsp;library,
          this searcher first uses a dynamic link facility to link the
          application with the library.
          hen it tries to find a C&nbsp;function inside the library to
          be used as the loader.
          he name of this C&nbsp;function is the string "<code>luaopen_</code>"
          concatenated with a copy of the module name where each dot
          is replaced by an underscore.
          Moreover, if the module name has a hyphen,
          its prefix up to (and including) the first hyphen is removed.
          For instance, if the module name is <code>a.v1-b.c</code>,
          the function name will be <code>luaopen_b_c</code>.


     <p>
          he fourth searcher tries an <em>all-in-one loader</em>.
          t searches the C&nbsp;path for a library for
          the root name of the given module.
          For instance, when requiring <code>a.b.c</code>,
          it will search for a C&nbsp;library for <code>a</code>.
          f found, it looks into it for an open function for
          the submodule;
          in our example, that would be <code>luaopen_a_b_c</code>.
          With this facility, a package can pack several C&nbsp;submodules
          into one single library,
          with each submodule keeping its original open function.

          including if necessary a path and extension.
          <code>funcname</code> must be the exact name exported by the C&nbsp;library
          (which may depend on the C&nbsp;compiler and linker used).


     <p>

          When indexing a string in Lua, the first character is at position&nbsp;1
          (not at&nbsp;0, as in C).
          ndices are allowed to be negative and are interpreted as indexing backwards,
          from the end of the string.
          hus, the last character is at position -1, and so on.


     <p>
          he string library provides all its functions inside the table

          t also sets a metatable for strings
          where the <code>__index</code> field points to the <code>string</code> table.
          herefore, you can use the string functions in object-oriented style.

     <h4>Character Class:</h4>
     <p>
           <em>character class</em> is used to represent a set of characters.
          he following combinations are allowed in describing a character class:

     <ul>

          <li><b><em>x</em>:</b>
               (where <em>x</em> is not one of the <em>magic characters</em>
               <code>^$()%.[]*+-?</code>)
               represents the character <em>x</em> itself.
          </li>

          <li><b><code>.</code>:</b> (a dot) represents all characters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%a</code>:</b> represents all letters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%c</code>:</b> represents all control characters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%d</code>:</b> represents all digits.</li>

          <li><b><code>%l</code>:</b> represents all lowercase letters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%p</code>:</b> represents all punctuation characters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%s</code>:</b> represents all space characters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%u</code>:</b> represents all uppercase letters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%w</code>:</b> represents all alphanumeric characters.</li>

          <li><b><code>%x</code>:</b> represents all hexadecimal digits.</li>

          <li><b><code>%z</code>:</b> represents the character with representation 0.</li>

          <li><b><code>%<em>x</em></code>:</b> (where <em>x</em> is any non-alphanumeric character)
               represents the character <em>x</em>.
               his is the standard way to escape the magic characters.
               ny punctuation character (even the non magic)
               can be preceded by a '<code>%</code>'
               when used to represent itself in a pattern.
          </li>

          <li><b><code>[<em>set</em>]</code>:</b>
               represents the class which is the union of all
               characters in <em>set</em>.
                range of characters can be specified by
               separating the end characters of the range with a '<code>-</code>'.
               ll classes <code>%</code><em>x</em> described above can also be used as
               components in <em>set</em>.
               ll other characters in <em>set</em> represent themselves.
               For example, <code>[%w_]</code> (or <code>[_%w]</code>)
               represents all alphanumeric characters plus the underscore,
               <code>[0-7]</code> represents the octal digits,
               and <code>[0-7%l%-]</code> represents the octal digits plus
               the lowercase letters plus the '<code>-</code>' character.


               <p>
                    he interaction between ranges and classes is not defined.
                    herefore, patterns like <code>[%a-z]</code> or <code>[a-%%]</code>
                    have no meaning.
          </li>

          <li><b><code>[^<em>set</em>]</code>:</b>
               represents the complement of <em>set</em>,
               where <em>set</em> is interpreted as above.
          </li>

     </ul>
     <p>
          For all classes represented by single letters (<code>%a</code>, <code>%c</code>, etc.),
          the corresponding uppercase letter represents the complement of the class.
          For instance, <code>%S</code> represents all non-space characters.


     <p>
          he definitions of letter, space, and other character groups
          depend on the current locale.
          n particular, the class <code>[a-z]</code> may not be equivalent to <code>%l</code>.





     <h4>Pattern tem:</h4>
     <p>
           <em>pattern item</em> can be

     <ul>

          <li>
               a single character class,
               which matches any single character in the class;
          </li>

          <li>
               a single character class followed by '<code>*</code>',
               which matches 0 or more repetitions of characters in the class.
               hese repetition items will always match the longest possible sequence;
          </li>

          <li>
               a single character class followed by '<code>+</code>',
               which matches 1 or more repetitions of characters in the class.
               hese repetition items will always match the longest possible sequence;
          </li>

          <li>
               a single character class followed by '<code>-</code>',
               which also matches 0 or more repetitions of characters in the class.
               Unlike '<code>*</code>',
               these repetition items will always match the <em>shortest</em> possible sequence;
          </li>

          <li>
               a single character class followed by '<code>?</code>',
               which matches 0 or 1 occurrence of a character in the class;
          </li>

          <li>
               <code>%<em>n</em></code>, for <em>n</em> between 1 and 9;
               such item matches a substring equal to the <em>n</em>-th captured string
               (see below);
          </li>

          <li>
               <code>%b<em>xy</em></code>, where <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are two distinct characters;
               such item matches strings that start with&nbsp;<em>x</em>, end with&nbsp;<em>y</em>,
               and where the <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are <em>balanced</em>.
               his means that, if one reads the string from left to right,
               counting <em>+1</em> for an <em>x</em> and <em>-1</em> for a <em>y</em>,
               the ending <em>y</em> is the first <em>y</em> where the count reaches 0.
               For instance, the item <code>%b()</code> matches expressions with
               balanced parentheses.
          </li>

     </ul>




     <h4>Pattern:</h4>
     <p>
           <em>pattern</em> is a sequence of pattern items.
           '<code>^</code>' at the beginning of a pattern anchors the match at the
          beginning of the subject string.
           '<code>$</code>' at the end of a pattern anchors the match at the
          end of the subject string.
          t other positions,
          '<code>^</code>' and '<code>$</code>' have no special meaning and represent themselves.





     <h4>Captures:</h4>
     <p>
           pattern can contain sub-patterns enclosed in parentheses;
          they describe <em>captures</em>.
          When a match succeeds, the substrings of the subject string
          that match captures are stored (<em>captured</em>) for future use.
          Captures are numbered according to their left parentheses.
          For instance, in the pattern <code>"(a*(.)%w(%s*))"</code>,
          the part of the string matching <code>"a*(.)%w(%s*)"</code> is
          stored as the first capture (and therefore has number&nbsp;1);
          the character matching "<code>.</code>" is captured with number&nbsp;2,
          and the part matching "<code>%s*</code>" has number&nbsp;3.


     <p>
          s a special case, the empty capture <code>()</code> captures
          the current string position (a number).
          For instance, if we apply the pattern <code>"()aa()"</code> on the
          string <code>"flaaap"</code>, there will be two captures: 3&nbsp;and&nbsp;5.


     <p>
           pattern cannot contain embedded zeros. Use <code>%z</code> instead.

          Most functions in the table library assume that the table
          represents an array or a list.
          For these functions, when we talk about the "length" of a table
          we mean the result of the length operator.

     from <code>table[1]</code> to <code>table[n]</code>,
     where <code>n</code> is the length of the table.
     f <code>comp</code> is given,
     then it must be a function that receives two table elements,
     and returns true
     when the first is less than the second
     (so that <code>not comp(a[i+1],a[i])</code> will be true after the sort).
     f <code>comp</code> is not given,
     then the standard Lua operator <code>&lt;</code> is used instead.


     <p>
          he sort algorithm is not stable;

          he /O library provides two different styles for file manipulation.
          he first one uses implicit file descriptors;
          that is, there are operations to set a default input file and a
          default output file,
          and all input/output operations are over these default files.
          he second style uses explicit file descriptors.


     <p>
          When using implicit file descriptors,
          all operations are supplied by table <a name="pdf-io"><code>io</code></a>.
          When using explicit file descriptors,
          the operation <a href="#pdf-io.open"><code>io.open</code></a> returns a file descriptor
          and then all operations are supplied as methods of the file descriptor.


     <p>
          he table <code>io</code> also provides
          three predefined file descriptors with their usual meanings from C:
          <a name="pdf-io.stdin"><code>io.stdin</code></a>, <a name="pdf-io.stdout"><code>io.stdout</code></a>, and <a

          or <b>nil</b> if it cannot read data with the specified format.
          When called without formats,
          it uses a default format that reads the entire next line

          and may have fields <code>hour</code>, <code>min</code>, <code>sec</code>, and <code>isdst</code>
          (for a description of these fields, see the <a href="#pdf-os.date"><code>os.date</code></a> function).


     <p>
          he returned value is a number, whose meaning depends on your system.
          n POSX, Windows, and some other systems, this number counts the number
          of seconds since some given start time (the "epoch").
          n other systems, the meaning is not specified,
          and the number returned by <code>time</code> can be used only as an argument to
          <code>date</code> and <code>difftime</code>.

     <h3><a name="pdf-os.tmpname"><code>os.tmpname ()</code></a></h3>


     <p>
          eturns a string with a file name that can
          be used for a temporary file.
          he file must be explicitly opened before its use
          and explicitly removed when no longer needed.


     <p>
          On some systems (POSX),
          this function also creates a file with that name,
          to avoid security risks.
          (Someone else might create the file with wrong permissions
          in the time between getting the name and creating the file.)
          ou still have to open the file to use it
          and to remove it (even if you do not use it).


     <p>
          When possible,
          you may prefer to use <a href="#pdf-io.tmpfile"><code>io.tmpfile</code></a>,
          which automatically removes the file when the program ends.







     <h2>5.9 - <a name="5.9">he Debug Library</a></h2>

     <p>
          his library provides
          the functionality of the debug interface to Lua programs.
          ou should exert care when using this library.
          he functions provided here should be used exclusively for debugging
          and similar tasks, such as profiling.
          Please resist the temptation to use them as a
          usual programming tool:
          they can be very slow.
          Moreover, several of these functions
          violate some assumptions about Lua code
          (e.g., that variables local to a function
          cannot be accessed from outside or
          that userdata metatables cannot be changed by Lua code)
          and therefore can compromise otherwise secure code.


     <p>
          ll functions in this library are provided
          inside the <a name="pdf-debug"><code>debug</code></a> table.
          ll functions that operate over a thread
          have an optional first argument which is the
          thread to operate over.
          he default is always the current thread.

          Using simple commands and other debug facilities,
          the user can inspect global and local variables,
          change their values, evaluate expressions, and so on.
           line containing only the word <code>cont</code> finishes this function,
          so that the caller continues its execution.


     <p>
          ote that commands for <code>debug.debug</code> are not lexically nested
          within any function, and so have no direct access to local variables.

          ou can give the function directly,
          or you can give a number as the value of <code>function</code>,
          which means the function running at level <code>function</code> of the call stack
          of the given thread:
          level&nbsp;0 is the current function (<code>getinfo</code> itself);
          level&nbsp;1 is the function that called <code>getinfo</code>;
          and so on.
          f <code>function</code> is a number larger than the number of active functions,
          then <code>getinfo</code> returns <b>nil</b>.

     <p>
          For instance, the expression <code>debug.getinfo(1,"n").name</code> returns
          a table with a name for the current function,
          if a reasonable name can be found,
          and the expression <code>debug.getinfo(print)</code>

          Sets the given function as a hook.
          he string <code>mask</code> and the number <code>count</code> describe
          when the hook will be called.
          he string mask may have the following characters,
          with the given meaning:

     <ul>
          <li><b><code>"c"</code>:</b> the hook is called every time Lua calls a function;</li>
          <li><b><code>"r"</code>:</b> the hook is called every time Lua returns from a function;</li>
          <li><b><code>"l"</code>:</b> the hook is called every time Lua enters a new line of code.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
          With a <code>count</code> different from zero,
          the hook is called after every <code>count</code> instructions.


     <p>
          When called without arguments,
          <a href="#pdf-debug.sethook"><code>debug.sethook</code></a> turns off the hook.


     <p>
          When the hook is called, its first parameter is a string
          describing the event that has triggered its call:
          <code>"call"</code>, <code>"return"</code> (or <code>"tail return"</code>,
          when simulating a return from a tail call),
          <code>"line"</code>, and <code>"count"</code>.
          For line events,
          the hook also gets the new line number as its second parameter.
          nside a hook,
          you can call <code>getinfo</code> with level&nbsp;2 to get more information about
          the running function
          (level&nbsp;0 is the <code>getinfo</code> function,
          and level&nbsp;1 is the hook function),
          unless the event is <code>"tail return"</code>.
          n this case, Lua is only simulating the return,
          and a call to <code>getinfo</code> will return invalid data.

     <h1>6 - <a name="6">Lua Stand-alone</a></h1>

     <p>
          lthough Lua has been designed as an extension language,
          to be embedded in a host C&nbsp;program,
          it is also frequently used as a stand-alone language.
          n interpreter for Lua as a stand-alone language,
          called simply <code>lua</code>,
          is provided with the standard distribution.
          he stand-alone interpreter includes
          all standard libraries, including the debug library.
          ts usage is:

     <pre>
     lua [options] [script [args]]
</pre>
     <p>
          he options are:

     <ul>
          <li><b><code>-e <em>stat</em></code>:</b> executes string <em>stat</em>;</li>
          <li><b><code>-l <em>mod</em></code>:</b> "requires" <em>mod</em>;</li>
          <li><b><code>-i</code>:</b> enters interactive mode after running <em>script</em>;</li>
          <li><b><code>-v</code>:</b> prints version information;</li>
          <li><b><code>--</code>:</b> stops handling options;</li>
          <li><b><code>-</code>:</b> executes <code>stdin</code> as a file and stops handling options.</li>
     </ul>
     <p>
          fter handling its options, <code>lua</code> runs the given <em>script</em>,
          passing to it the given <em>args</em> as string arguments.
          When called without arguments,
          <code>lua</code> behaves as <code>lua -v -i</code>
          when the standard input (<code>stdin</code>) is a terminal,
          and as <code>lua -</code> otherwise.


     <p>
          Before running any argument,
          the interpreter checks for an environment variable <a name="pdf-LU_"><code>LU_</code></a>.
          f its format is <code>@<em>filename</em></code>,
          then <code>lua</code> executes the file.
          Otherwise, <code>lua</code> executes the string itself.


     <p>
          ll options are handled in order, except <code>-i</code>.
          For instance, an invocation like

     <pre>
     $ lua -e'a=1' -e 'print(a)' script.lua
</pre>
     <p>
          will first set <code>a</code> to 1, then print the value of <code>a</code> (which is '<code>1</code>'),
          and finally run the file <code>script.lua</code> with no arguments.
          (Here <code>$</code> is the shell prompt. our prompt may be different.)


     <p>
          Before starting to run the script,
          <code>lua</code> collects all arguments in the command line
          in a global table called <code>arg</code>.
          he script name is stored at index 0,
          the first argument after the script name goes to index 1,
          and so on.
          ny arguments before the script name
          (that is, the interpreter name plus the options)
          go to negative indices.
          For instance, in the call

     <pre>
     $ lua -la b.lua t1 t2
</pre>
     <p>
          the interpreter first runs the file <code>a.lua</code>,
          then creates a table

     <pre>
     arg = { [-2] = "lua", [-1] = "-la",
             [0] = "b.lua",
             [1] = "t1", [2] = "t2" }
</pre>
     <p>
          and finally runs the file <code>b.lua</code>.
          he script is called with <code>arg[1]</code>, <code>arg[2]</code>, &middot;&middot;&middot;
          as arguments;
          it can also access these arguments with the vararg expression '<code>...</code>'.


     <p>
          n interactive mode,
          if you write an incomplete statement,
          the interpreter waits for its completion
          by issuing a different prompt.


     <p>
          f the global variable <a name="pdf-_POMP"><code>_POMP</code></a> contains a string,
          then its value is used as the prompt.
          Similarly, if the global variable <a name="pdf-_POMP2"><code>_POMP2</code></a> contains a string,
          its value is used as the secondary prompt
          (issued during incomplete statements).
          herefore, both prompts can be changed directly on the command line
          or in any Lua programs by assigning to <code>_POMP</code>.
          See the next example:

     <pre>
     $ lua -e"_POMP='myprompt&gt; '" -i
</pre>
     <p>
          (he outer pair of quotes is for the shell,
          the inner pair is for Lua.)
          ote the use of <code>-i</code> to enter interactive mode;
          otherwise,
          the program would just end silently
          right after the assignment to <code>_POMP</code>.


     <p>
          o allow the use of Lua as a
          script interpreter in Unix systems,
          the stand-alone interpreter skips
          the first line of a chunk if it starts with <code>#</code>.
          herefore, Lua scripts can be made into executable programs
          by using <code>chmod +x</code> and the&nbsp;<code>#!</code> form,
          as in

     <pre>
     #!/usr/local/bin/lua
</pre>
     <p>
          (Of course,
          the location of the Lua interpreter may be different in your machine.
          f <code>lua</code> is in your <code>PH</code>,
          then

     <pre>
     #!/usr/bin/env lua
</pre>
     <p>
          is a more portable solution.)

               but <code>require</code> gets the path from <a href="#pdf-package.path"><code>package.path</code></a>
               instead
               of from <code>LU_PH</code>.
          </li>

          <li>
               Function <a href="#pdf-collectgarbage"><code>collectgarbage</code></a> has different arguments.
               Function <code>gcinfo</code> is deprecated;
               use <code>collectgarbage("count")</code> instead.
          </li>

     <ul>

          <li>
               he <code>luaopen_*</code> functions (to open libraries)
               cannot be called directly,
               like a regular C function.
               hey must be called through Lua,
               like a Lua function.
          </li>

          <li>
               Function <code>lua_open</code> was replaced by <a href="#lua_newstate"><code>lua_newstate</code></a> to
               allow the user to set a memory-allocation function.
               ou can use <a href="#luaL_newstate"><code>luaL_newstate</code></a> from the standard library to
               create a state with a standard allocation function
               (based on <code>realloc</code>).
          </li>

          <li>
               Functions <code>luaL_getn</code> and <code>luaL_setn</code>
               (from the auxiliary library) are deprecated.
               Use <a href="#lua_objlen"><code>lua_objlen</code></a> instead of <code>luaL_getn</code>
               and nothing instead of <code>luaL_setn</code>.
          </li>

          <li>
               Function <code>luaL_openlib</code> was replaced by <a
                    href="#luaL_register"><code>luaL_register</code></a>.
          </li>

          <li>
               Function <code>luaL_checkudata</code> now throws an error when the given value
               is not a userdata of the expected type.
               (n Lua&nbsp;5.0 it returned <code>ULL</code>.)
